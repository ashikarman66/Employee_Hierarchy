# Employee Hierarchy Project in Java

## Project Overview
This Java project demonstrates a simple **employee hierarchy** using **inheritance** and **method overriding**. It models a basic organizational structure with `Employee` as the base class and `Manager` as the derived class. The program highlights key **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** such as inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, and the `super` keyword.

## Features
- Base class `Employee` with attributes:
  - `name` (String)
  - `id` (int)
  - `basicSalary` (double)
- Derived class `Manager` with additional attribute:
  - `department` (String)
- Method `displayInfo()` in `Employee` is **overridden** in `Manager`.
- Demonstrates **runtime polymorphism** using parent class references.
- Uses constructors and the `super` keyword for proper initialization.
